# Assiggnment_square
For the task of drone performing a square trajectory in Gazebo simulator using python API
This code uses PYTHON API's
Following API's are used:
1.Takeoff snd landing
2.Position set point from navigation API .Which uses body frame of the drone for making any trajectory.
3.And at the shutdown API
While executing code in command prompt user need to input the square length
Height of takeoff is predefined in the code as 5m (it should be grater than 1.5)
Then save the python code file to a desired location (Remember you will be entering the location of this file after executing openshell command) 
##Help for the executing command and steps for meeting software requirement
Steps for meeting software requirement:
1.Installing Linux
2. Installing flytsim
stepwise coomands to be run in the command prompt
1.sudo ./start.sh
2.sudo ./openshell.sh
3.Entering the python file location and the side of square.
4. sudo ./stop.sh
